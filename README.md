# tsks

[![build](https://app.travis-ci.com/luanrv/tsks-cli.svg?branch=main)](https://app.travis-ci.com/luanrv/tsks-cli)

A stateful command line interface to help you handle your daily tsks (with
synchronisation and contexts!).

## Features

- Add tsks, check what is already done and list active or archived tsks
- Synchronise your tsks and access them from all your terminals!
  (soon accessible from a webapp as well)
- Increase your daily tsks management with contexts using
  `tsks add tsk --context=today` (see `tsks help add` for more info)

## Installation

```ruby
gem install tsks
```

## Usage

After follow the step above you should be able to run `tsks` from your terminal.

_It's important to notice that you will need to run `tsks init` to setup stuffs
like the storage before any other command._

### Adding new tsks

```sh
tsks add "My first tsk"
```

**Adding with context**

```sh
tsks add "Bootstraps my pet project environment" --context=Today
```

### Marking tsks as done

```sh
tsks done 2 # Where 2 is the tsk id
```

### Listing your tsks

```sh
tsks list
```

**Filtering by context**

```sh
tsks list --context=Today
```

**Or tsks already done**

```sh
tsks list --done
```

**Tip:** It's possible to combine the flags `--done` and `--context` when
listing.

### Synchronising your tsks

As easy as running `tsks sync`. This command will fetch your tsks from the API,
then filter what is not synchronised yet from local, then update both
remote and local tsks with most recent data.

#### To be able to sync you will need to login or register an account

Run this to login:

```sh
tsks login --email=sample@mail.com --password=secret
```

Or this to register an account:

```sh
tsks register --email=sample@mail.com --password=secret
```

## Developing

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run
`rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive
prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`
(This command installs the current tsks version in your machine).

## Releasing

```sh
./bin/release
```
